# lung-cancer-prediction-using-machine-learning
Lung cancer is the uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in one or both of the lungs. Cigarette smoking causes most lung cancers when smoke gets in the lungs. Lung cancer kills 1.8 million people each year, more than any other cancer. It has a 80-90% death rate, and is the leading cause of cancer death in men, and the second leading cause of cancer death in women.

The large majority of people who get lung cancer have smoked for many years. However, there are types of lung cancers that appear in otherwise healthy patients who have never smoked.

This project aims to predict the likelihood of lung cancer in patients based on certain clinical and demographic features. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yusufdede/lung-cancer-dataset]

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about patients diagnosed with lung cancer, including their age, sex, smoking history, yellow fingers, alcohol consuming,etc , and lung cancer result. The dataset is available and is stored in CSV format.

## Requirements

To run the code in this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3 (with NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab 

## Usage

To run the code in this project, you can open the `lung cancer prediction.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and run the cells sequentially. The notebook contains detailed instructions on how to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the predictive model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The predictive model trained in this project achieves an accuracy of 96% on the test set, with a precision of 97% and a recall of 96%. These results suggest that the model is reasonably accurate in predicting the likelihood of lung cancer in patients based on their clinical features.
